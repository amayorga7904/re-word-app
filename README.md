# WORD-IQ

This is a MERN app that uses OpenAI and is dedicated to improving your knowledge in Programming and Math, and vernacular in English.

Simply, sign up (email and password do not have specific requirements), and navigate to whichever page desired. There are 3 options: Prompts, Codes, and Math. 

All information that is returned by the AI will by saved in the History section dedicated to each page where you can change the title of each solution for better organization and unwanted information can be deleted.

## FEATURES
* "New Prompts" will provide a more formal and sophisticated tone to the given text. 

* "New Code" will explain the given code in a concise way.

* "New Math Equation" will give you a step-by-step solution to how the math problem can be solved. 

* "Donate" section that uses a TEST Stripe API link. Made for fun. 

### BIGGEST CHALLENGE
Getting the OpenAI API to initially work properly was tough. A lot of research went into this app. Once that worked, the challenged that followed were minor but overlooked errors caused me to take too much time in debugging. 

### KEY TAKEAWAY
Prior to this, the useage of APIs was deliberately avoided for the fear of the unknown. I challenged myself with this project by doing something different and asking for as little assistance as possible in preparedness for the real world experience. It's not so bad.
